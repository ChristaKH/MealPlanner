# MealPlanner
Personal meal planning app (In Progress) 

This app is a personal project with the goal of promoting healthier eating as well as discouraging habits such 
as unnecessary eating out through careful meal planning.

## SplashActivity 
This is the first Activity that the user sees and acts as kind of a loading screen. Current splash activity has the app title fade into view in white against a colored background. Future additions may include the app logo and a custom animation that spins the logo before continuing to the LoginActivity.
